About me üë©‚Äçüíª

I am **Samuel Dushimimana**, a graduate from the first cohort in Software Engineering and Embedded Systems at [**Rwanda Coding Academy**](http://rca.ac.rw/) with more than 4 years of experience in building full stack applications. I'm so excited to be a part of FOSSology community in Google Summer of Code 2023.

In this article am going to outline the details of my contributions as a reference of project completion during the 12 weeks of coding.

# üåè CONTRIBUTIONS Overview 

   During my participation in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program, I focused on implementing and enhancing eight key features within the project:

  1. #### License File View Management:
     I developed the REST APIs that tackled on extracting file contents and making the clearing decisions about associated licenses. This involved extracting, processing and highlighting 
     license information from the files.
  3. #### License Browser:
     I designed a set of APIs to facilitate the presentation of a tree view of files and their corresponding license details. Additionally, I implemented APIs that provided summary statistics 
     about the licenses associated with a particular uploaded content.
  4. #### Folder and Content Management:
     The task encompassed creating essential APIs for managing folder contents. This involved tasks such as retrieving removable contents from folders and unlinking contents from specific 
     parent folders.
  5. #### Admin Dashboard Management:
     I played a role in designing APIs that served different components of the Admin dashboard. These APIs provided data such as database metrics and job statistics, contributing to the 
     effective monitoring of the system.
  6. #### License Admin Management:
     I developed REST APIs that helped the system Admin to handle different operations on acknowledgments and standard comments related to licenses.
  7. #### CSV Operations:
     Another aspect of my work involved designing REST APIs for importing and exporting licenses and obligations using CSV files.
  8. #### Manual Scheduling of Operations:
     I created REST APIs that allowed administrators to schedule and execute various operations manually. 
  9. #### FOssology API V2 configuration:
     I improved the configuration of the REST APIs to accommodate FOssology API Version 2. This enhancement ensured compatibility with future versions and streamlined the process of 
     incorporating upcoming changes.

Let's dive into each category in details to showcase all the contributions with the corresponding tests in screenshots where possible and the respective links to the Pull requests.

#### FOssology API V2 configuration

Redesigned the FOSSology API Config to support version 2 of REST APIs. Currently, the codebase was designed to support only version 1 of REST APIS which would be hard to introduce and utilize the new features offered by Version 2. [#2576](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2576)
 


## Documentation:üìÑ

During the GSoC period, I got the time to create and organize documentation for both the [**FOSSology UI**](https://github.com/fossology/FOSSologyUI) and FOSSology [**REST-API**](https://github.com/fossology/fossology). The documentation contains all the user and developer information of the project and is organized in a way to be easily accessible by all.

The weekly documentation of updates can be found at [**FOSSology/gsoc**](https://fossology.github.io/gsoc/docs/2022/ui/updates/samuel/2021-06-24)

| Tasks   | Planned | Completed     | Remarks    |
| :---:       |    :----:   |    :---:      |    :---:      |
| Adding new pages and improved existing UI   | Yes       | :heavy_check_mark: | The UI still needs more work both on the look and functionalities to enhance the user experience. |
| Adding almost all APIs on GROUPs module , Maintenance and License   | Yes        | :heavy_check_mark:  | More APIs will continously need to be added as the UI Migration progresses |
| Fixing some potential the existing bugs| Yes | :heavy_check_mark: | There're still alot of issues to work on , escpecially on the side of  [FOSSology](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/issues) |
| Fixing Vulnerable FOSSology UI's dependencies| NO (WAS OPTIONAL) | :x: | Dependencies are continously added so this's approgressive task|
| Integrating OAuth 2.0 | NO (WAS OPTIONAL) | :x: | Got the overview still needs more lessons to learn how to integrate it in the existing projects|

## Future enhancements:üöÄ

- Adding the skeleton loading on the UI components when the items are being fetched.
- Adding search utilities on the select components from the UI.
- Adding the pagination to the GET list APIs where appropriate and it's applicable.
- Completing to add all the remaining pages on the License Administration Section.
- Adding more REST-APIs from the backend.
- Implementing Data caching on the UI to speed up the data display.

## Major Takeaways: üìö

- The project has familiarized me to write clean code for the REST-API end points.
- I was taught how to write smart urls for my end points.
- I explored the best practices of writing Javascript codes specifically for React Js.
- Left me with a tangible experience of working remotely.
- Gained the confidence of working on large codebases and learned how to meintain consistency in the enormous community of contributors.
- I learned the power of collaboration and working in a team.
- Got cool experience on contributing to the opensource projects.
- The last but not least i learned how to code like an expert , it was a great privilege to learn from the previous work of the talented engineers a broad.
